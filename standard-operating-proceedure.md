- Labels, make your artists love you.
- Artists form your own label.

## Recruitment and Onboarding

** How we decide artists should be signed to the label.**

1. Meet artist at party/online/at gig.

1. Artist and label connect through Facebook / email / in person contact.
Artist submits Soundcloud page, public or private links to urls, a biography, vision statement. 

2. After some discussion, the artist is "signed" to our label by unanimous agreement of visionaries. 

3. The artist is provisioned with an Artist account. The artist can accept the "signing" and terms and conditions of the label. The artist can then log in to Artist account.

## Development and Release Preparation

**How we develop tracks/mixes and decide if they are ready to release.**

*Agnostic of front-end*

1. Given all artists on the label have an Artist account. An artist can log into the platform.

1. Once logged in the Artist can submit a release candidate:
	- track title
	- soundcloud url
	- description
	- version

		To make it explicit, let's stick to the following format: 

		Release Candidate
		Title: 
		Soundcloud URL (Probably private): 
		Track description/information: 
		Version (e.g. 1,2,3,4 etc): 

		An example:

		Release Candidate
		Title: Relax, Freak
		Soundcloud URL (Probably private): https://soundcloud.com/sebastian-sibelle/relax-freak/s-iO0Is
		Track description/information: With this track I'm trying to embody the feeling of an exhale/relaxation by building stress and tension and then releasing it abruptly. The juxtaposition of course is that for most of the track it's about building stress and not relaxing. 
		Version (e.g. 1,2,3,4 etc): 1


5. The release candidate appears on admin home page for all Users. The Artist can also view release candidates from other Artists on the label, including ones in the past.

6. A notification that a release candidate has been posted is sent to all Visionaries
	- Pending release candidates (one which require a response) will show up the top of the Visionaries home page.
7. Other artists can listen and leave comments on the track.
	- Artists can download the track for use in their sets performance
8. Visionaries can listen, leave comments and approve / deny the release.
	- If the visionary denies the release candidate, then they must leave a constructive comment as to why.
	- If the release candidate is denied, it can be re-submitted with a new version at any time.
10. Once all visionaries approve the release it is ready for finalisation
11. The Artist or any Visionary must add these additional details to finalise the release
 	- Release image
 	- Public Soundcloud url (mastered version)
 	- Bandcamp / Beatport download (for tracks/optional)
 	- Mp3 for download (for tracks/optional)
 	- Press kit (for tracks/optional)
 	- Proofed Description ()
 	- Release/Mix no

12. Once all the details have been provided both the artist and visionaries must approve the release. Once this has happened, the release is said to be "live". Tracks will be scheduled into a released schedule queue and released at optimum timing to increase exposure for artists/label. 

13. A visionary must then repost the Soundcloud track to the Jus B Chill soundcloud page
